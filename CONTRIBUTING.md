## Contribution Guidelines

TL;DR - Me likey clean code, Me not always makey clean code, Me likey pull requests.

You don't have anything better to do? Uuuh okay, Try to maintain PSR-2 Wherever possible, If possible try to abstract stuff into methods that would be nicer for the end user (read - developer that's been lumbered with this framework) to use.

If you submit a PR and it gets rejected without much information - By all means please do prod me with (at)mentions and request more information.
