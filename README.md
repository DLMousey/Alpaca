## Alpaca Framework
A dinky little PHP Framework i'm tinkering about with - Because it's one thing knowing how to use components to build something cool, It's another thing knowing how those components work.

### Project Goals
Use as few third party packages as possible in the creation of this framework - I've already allowed myself to use Doctrine (because yeah writing an ORM would be pretty great but i don't have months of free time i can throw at it) and Symfony's Var Dumper.

Other than that i want to stay as dependency free as possible, It's basically a matter of time before that changes though let's face it.

### Disclaimer
This framework is in no way, shape or form production or even development ready. Consider all branches volatile and unstable - If you run this in production or base any of your own projects on it, Well you're a bit of a muppet then aren't you?

Wait, Why are you typing git clo-STOP!
